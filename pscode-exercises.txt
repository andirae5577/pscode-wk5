// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Declare Num1 As Real
Declare Num2 As Real
Declare Sum As Real

Write "Enter a number:", Num1
Write "Enter a number:", Num2

Set Sum= Num 1 + Num 2

Write Num 1 "+" Num 2 "=" Sum


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Declare Num As Integer

Write "Enter a number:", Num
If Num % = 0
	Write Num "is even"
Else 
	Write Num "is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Declare Num[5] of Reals
Declare Sum As Real
Declare Avg As Real
Declare K As Integer

Set Sum = 0
For K = 1 Step 1 to 5
Write "Enter a Number:",K
Input Num[K]
Set Sum = Sum + Num K
End For

Set Avg = Sum/5
For K=1 Step 1 to 5 
	Write "The Number is:" K, [K]
End For

Write "The Average is:" Average

For K = 1 Step 1 to 4
	If Num[K] > [Num]K-1 Then
		Interchange Num[K] and Num[K-1]
	End if
End For
Write "The Max is:" Num[K] 

For K = 1 Step 1 to 4
	If Num[K] < [Num]K-1 Then
		Interchange Num[K] and Num[K-1]
	End if
Write "The Min is:" Num[K]
